## Introduction&#x20;

Wing of Misadventure will create an environment where players can share Free-To-Play and Play-To-Earn space in a healthy way, without assigning the Pay-To-Win factor, this will be done as follows:

\-Everyone can play and explore the game for free, including getting rare items.&#x20;

\-Features that allow you to farm NFTs and $MISAD do not assign strength

#### Using this as a main rule the $MISAD will be the following use cases:

\-NFT Mint to farm $MISAD and other NFTs&#x20;

\-Purchase items in the [Wing Shop](../game/wing-shop.md).&#x20;

\-Registration for championships and events.&#x20;

\-Fee for entering dungeons that give NFTs as rewards&#x20;

\-You will be able to trade $MISAD through the trade window with other players&#x20;

\-Stake $MISAD with fair APR

\-Future partnerships with other projects may encourage the token to be used in other cryptocurrency sectors

\-Others yet to be defined in the future (check[ Misad Blockchain](../future/misad-blockchain.md))

Each $MISAD transaction will have a 3% fee where 100% of the fee is burned weekly, making $MISAD a deflationary currency.

#### Burning

Part of the coin is burned whenever:

\-Players make a trade with another player

\-A purchase is made on the market

\-A player mint or renews an NFT (in which case 5% is burned)

\-A player enters a dungeon

\-A player signs up for a tournament or event

This makes everyone end up contributing to token deflation.

#### F2P players contribute to the ecosystem in the following ways:&#x20;

\-Purchase skins or any items from the in-game store&#x20;

\-Participating in tournaments and events&#x20;

\-Trading with other players&#x20;

\-Making purchases on the marketplace

\-Becoming an audience for the project and a possible word spreader

#### The reward pool will also decrease with each cycle

With the constant deflation of the token, the reward pool will be equitably reduced to keep Play-To-Earn's APR healthy and prevent token dumps in the market. It also means that it doesn't matter if you enter at the beginning of the project or in the future, holding is always an interesting option.

#### _Do we always depend on new people coming in? No! Just people having fun. We can have a healthy economy if there are people in the community who play the game because it's a game._

#### No need to pay a fee to use the token in-game!&#x20;

$MISAD needs to be deposited in the game to be used, the token charge is done within the game without using gas.

### Token Mechanics

#### 6.8% fee on every out-of-game transaction

Each transaction made outside the game charges a **4.8% fee** that goes directly to the [community treasury](../community-treasure.md).

#### _1% is automatically reserved for liquidity as follows:_

The contract reserves 1% in its own token balance until it reaches a specific amount of tokens, the amount can be queried in BscScan by the variable numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity

When the amount is reached, the contract takes the following steps:

\-Swap half of the tokens for BNB

\-Adds the BNB and remaining tokens in the liquidity.

The contract does not calculate price changes, therefore, there is a BNB margin from the impact of selling half of the tokens that is not included in the liquidity and remains in the contract, whenever the BNB balance of the contract reaches 0.01, the contract uses the BNB to buyback $MISAD, and sends the $MISAD to the community treasury.

#### _**1% will be distributed to all holders.**_

## **T**emporary fee

The token fees will be progressively reduced over the months and years as $MISAD slowly links up with other metaverse projects.

## $TAMAS tax to move $MISAD

To transfer $MISAD from the game to your wallet or to carry out $MISAD trades within the game, you need to pay a fee of [$TAMAS](usdtamas.md)
