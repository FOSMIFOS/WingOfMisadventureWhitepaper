# Guilds

Players will be able to create guilds and dominate territories, guilds will gain from the loot of the dominated territory:

\-A percentage of the tamas dropped in the territory.

\-A small chance to get items dropped in the territory.

The territory can be attacked by dungeon monsters and other guilds, so having members always active to defend the territory will be important.

Guild creation will cost [$MISAD](../play-to-earn/usdmisad.md).
