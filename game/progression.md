# Progression

Whenever you create a new character, it starts at level 1.

Defeating monsters, completing quests or special events grants experience, which eventually increases your character's level.

When you level up, you gain:

\-Status increase, which makes your character stronger

\-Skill points that allow you to unlock active and passive skills.

\-You will be able to equip stronger equipment
