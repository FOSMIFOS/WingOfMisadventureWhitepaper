There will be many objectives to be conquered in Misadventure and the chosen objective must suit the player's style of play:

#### Story

In Misadventure, you can follow the story to find out about the game's world, the story mode can give you important rewards to increase your character's strength.

#### Farm

You will be able to spend your time defeating monsters and getting items and coins, weak monsters give low rewards, but in excess they can be worth a lot.

#### Dungeons

There are dungeons for P2E players that can award $MISAD and NFTs, for F2P players there is no chance of dropping $MISAD or Remnants, but there are F2P dungeons with low chance of dropping NFT Goddess equipment.



#### BOT Policy

It is important to our ecosystem that BOTS do not exist, so the following must be done:

\-A large group of moderators must follow the game and the players.&#x20;

\-Monsters with relevant rewards should be hard to defeat.&#x20;

\-Accounts that automate actions should be banned.
