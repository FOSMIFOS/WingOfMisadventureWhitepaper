# Sustainability

There are specific points that make Wing of Misadventure truly sustainable in an NFT blockchain gaming economy:

\-Our focus is on being a real game, so our post-game marketing is fully focused on the F2P audience. This means that we want the number of players who play the game for fun to be greater than the number of players who play the game for profit.

\-Investors will receive the profits from the F2P public, this means that the money received by the project will no longer depend on new investors, but on real players.

\-Investors are encouraged to help the project grow by just inviting people to play, spreading the word is like helping your own investment.

\-The problem of NFTs games in which pyramids arise because the projects do not have the ability to profit without investors ceases to exist from the moment the game is real and moves the entertainment market.

\-The play-to-win factor will be encouraged but the number of tokens distributed by P2E will never be more than the game's treasure can pay, so rewards are set based on the game's growth, the more the game grows in the market, the more investors win. There is no reason to encourage investors to enter with promises of quick gains, we must conquer the gaming market, not the betting market.

## Case study:

Imagine that you entered as an investor at the beginning of an MMORPG buying 10% of the game's assets (tokens and NFTs). An MMORPG that then had an annual revenue of $100,000,000 received that amount from entertainment alone (conservative value based on some famous games on the market without P2E model), value that was applied to the game token.
